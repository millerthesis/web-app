# Gentrification index

This index was created by using Census data from the 2000 Decennial and 2016 American Community Survey and attempts to quantify the level of gentrification of an area by measuring the changes in population of white people, median age, median home value, number of owner-occupied homes, number of people with at least a bachelor's degree and income per capita. These data points were chosen based on similar gentrification analyses by Governing magazine and the Cleveland Federal Reserve.

## The factors for this index

Each variable is weighted based on perceived impact on gentrification. These weights are based on factors found to be associated with gentrification in an analysis conducted by Richard Florida of CityLab. In their analysis, they found the factors that impact gentrification most to be income per capita (positive correlation of .61), number of college-educated residents (.51), and housing prices (.40). They did not rate the number of owner-occupied units or median age for their correlation with gentrification, and they found no correlation between race and gentrification at the neighborhood level.

As such, I have weighted each data variable accordingly: income per capita (.30), population with bachelor's or higher (.25), median home value, percentage of owner-occupied housing units (.15), median age (.05) and percentage of white people (.05).


**From 2000 to 2016**

- Change in white population 
- Change in median age
- Change in median home values
- Change in owners vs renters
- Change in population with bachelor's degree or higher
- Change in income per capita



### Change in white population

This is considered to be a factor in gentrification based on the study by Governing magazine. In their analysis on gentrification, they found that "compared to lower-income areas that failed to gentrify, gentrifying Census tracts recorded increases in the non-Hispanic white population." However, in the analysis conducted by Richard Florida of CityLab, they did not find the population of white residents to be correlated with gentrification. That said, the increase in the total white population is often considered to be a sign of gentrification in a neighborhood, so I include it in my index. However, because it was not found to have a significant correlation with gentrification, I give it a low weighting of .05.

### Change in median age

While age, like change in white population, did not have a significant positive correlation with gentrification based on the CityLab analysis, other researchers have found that median age is a factor in identifying gentrification. Pete Saunders, an urban planner, wrote in his <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petesaunders1/2016/08/29/understanding-gentrification/#4a2e625635ec">study</a> on gentrification that "...a gentrified community is one with a lower age than the metro area." Beyond that, gentrified communities are often considered to be comprised of young, affluent and educated residents. For that reason, I decided to include it in my index but give it a smaller weight of .05.


### Change in median home value

Both the CityLab analysis and the Cleveland Federal Reserve report include rising home values as indicators of gentrifying areas. In the Cleveland Federal Reserve study, Hartley exclusively used median home prices to measure whether an area had gentrified between 2000 and 2007. He defines gentrification as a Census Tract "that moved from the bottom half of the distribution of home prices in the metropolitan area to the top half between 2000 and 2007." Meanwhile, the CityLab analysis found that home values had a positive correlation with gentrification of .40. Therefore, I chose to give it a weight of .20 in my index.

### Change in owners v. renters

As neighborhoods gentrify, rent prices tend to <a href="https://gjplp.org/2017/09/05/examining-the-negative-impacts-of-gentrification/">increase</a> as luxury condominiums and high-rises replace poorer, older buildings. Similarly, units become converted from rental apartments to condominiums, townhomes and single-family homes for <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02723638.2016.1276718">ownership</a>. While the other analyses did not use the proportion of owner-occupied homes as a factor in measuring gentrification, I include it in my index, but give it a lesser weight of (.15).

### Change in population with bachelor's degree

Both analyses that I considered in creating my index rate the population of college-educated residents as an important factor in measuring gentrification. The CityLab analysis found that college-educated residents had a positive correlation with gentrification of .51. Similarly, the University of Massachusetts - Boston found that in gentrifying neighborhoods the population of those with college-degrees <a href="https://scholarworks.umb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1027&context=honors_theses">increased</a> over time. Therefore, I give it a weight of .25 in my index.

### Income per capita

Finally, I include income per capita in the index because it was found to have a positive correlation of .61 with gentrification, the highest of any other factor measured in the CityLab study. Thomas B. Edsall, an opinion writer and researcher, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/25/opinion/the-gentrification-effect.html">wrote</a> in 2015 that "education and income move in tandem â€“ that is, levels of per capita income follow the same pattern as levels of educational attainment." Because of its perceived impact on the level of gentrification in areas, I include it in my index with the highest weight of .30.
