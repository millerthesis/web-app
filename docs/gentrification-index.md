# Gentrification index

This index was created by using Census data from the 2011 and 2016 American Community Survey and attempts to quantify the level of gentrification of an area by measuring the changes in income per capita, median home value, population with bachelor's degree or higher, percent owner-occupied homes, population of white people and population below poverty line. These data points were chosen based on similar gentrification analyses by Governing magazine, Cleveland Federal Reserve and the <a href="http://voorheescenter.uic.edu/what-we-do/areas-of-research/gentrification-index/">Voorhees Center</a> at the University of Illinois, Chicago.

## The factors for this index

This index was created by using Census data from the 2011 and 2016 American Community Survey and attempts to quantify the level of gentrification of an area by measuring the population of white people, population below poverty level, median home value, number of owner-occupied homes, number of people with at least a bachelor's degree and income per capita. These data points were chosen based on similar gentrification analyses by Governing magazine and the Cleveland Federal Reserve.

### Income per capita

I include income per capita in the index because it was found to have a positive correlation of .61 with gentrification, the highest of any other factor measured in the CityLab study. Thomas B. Edsall, an opinion writer and researcher, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/25/opinion/the-gentrification-effect.html">wrote</a> in 2015 that "education and income move in tandem â€“ that is, levels of per capita income follow the same pattern as levels of educational attainment." The score range for income per capita is based on the current U.S. income per capita of approximately $58,000.


### Median home value

Both the CityLab analysis and the Cleveland Federal Reserve report include rising home values as indicators of gentrifying areas. In the Cleveland Federal Reserve study, Hartley exclusively used median home prices to measure whether an area had gentrified between 2000 and 2007. He defines gentrification as a Census Tract "that moved from the bottom half of the distribution of home prices in the metropolitan area to the top half between 2000 and 2007." Meanwhile, the CityLab analysis found that home values had a positive correlation with gentrification of .40. The score range for median home value is based on the current U.S. median home value of approximately $189,000.


### Population with bachelor's degree

Both analyses that I considered in creating my index rate the population of college-educated residents as an important factor in measuring gentrification. The CityLab analysis found that college-educated residents had a positive correlation with gentrification of .51. Similarly, the University of Massachusetts - Boston found that in gentrifying neighborhoods the population of those with college-degrees <a href="https://scholarworks.umb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1027&context=honors_theses">increased</a> over time. The score range for population with bachelor's degree is based on the current population of Americans with at least a bachelor's degree, which is approximately 30%.

### Number of owner-occupied homes

As neighborhoods gentrify, rent prices tend to <a href="https://gjplp.org/2017/09/05/examining-the-negative-impacts-of-gentrification/">increase</a> as luxury condominiums and high-rises replace poorer, older buildings. Similarly, units become converted from rental apartments to condominiums, townhomes and single-family homes for <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02723638.2016.1276718">ownership</a>. While the other analyses did not use the proportion of owner-occupied homes as a factor in measuring gentrification, I include it in my index. The score range for number of owner-occupied homes is based on the current U.S. population in owner-occupied homes, which is approximately 63%.


### White population

This is considered to be a factor in gentrification based on the study by Governing magazine. In their analysis on gentrification, they found that "compared to lower-income areas that failed to gentrify, gentrifying Census tracts recorded increases in the non-Hispanic white population." However, in the analysis conducted by Richard Florida of CityLab, they did not find the population of white residents to be correlated with gentrification. That said, the increase in the total white population is often considered to be a sign of gentrification in a neighborhood, so I include it in my index. The score range for white population is based on the current U.S. population of white people which is approximately 77%.


### Number below poverty line

I include the poverty level in my index because it reflects the proportion of poor residents in a community. As gentrification occurs, rents tend to rise which displaces the poorer communities from that existing area. The higher amount of people living below the poverty line, the less likely that area is to be gentrified. I include this factor in my index as it was included in the <a href="http://voorheescenter.uic.edu/what-we-do/areas-of-research/gentrification-index/">Voorhees Center</a> study on gentrification. The score range for population below poverty level is based on the current U.S. percentage of approximately 12%.
