                            Gentrification is generally <a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/flagwars/what-is-gentrification/">described</a> as the process of wealthier individuals moving into an existing community, a process that often increases property values, rent prices, and changes the culture and demography of the area.

                            While gentrified areas may become safer, see an increase in economic opportunity and have better schools, gentrification also leads to <a href="https://gjplp.org/2017/09/05/examining-the-negative-impacts-of-gentrification/">displacement</a> of the poorer communities that existed previously.
