    <h3>Washington, D.C.</h3>

            The nation's capital is home to some of the most heavily-gentrifying zip codes in the country, according to an <a href="https://www.rentcafe.com/blog/rental-market/real-estate-news/top-20-gentrified-zip-codes/">analysis</a> by RentCafe. In fact, two of the top 20 gentrified zipcodes are located in D.C., with home values going up an average of 176 percent between 2000-2016. For decades, black residents were the majority in the city -- making up 70 percent of residents in 1980 -- until 2015, when that number fell to 48 percent.

    <h3>St. Louis, MO</h3>

        <p>
            St. Louis is notable because it is the only Midwest city on <a href="https://www.rentcafe.com/blog/rental-market/real-estate-news/top-20-gentrified-zip-codes/">RentCafe's</a> list of most gentrified zipcodes between 2000-2016. Unlike other rapidly-gentrifying cities, the population of St. Louis city has declined over the last several decades (it peaked at 856,000 in 1950; it now has approximately 311,000 residents), and real estate prices remain relatively modest, with the average one-bedroom apartment renting for <a href="https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/mo/saint-louis/">$800</a>.
        </p>

    <h3>Fort Worth, TX</h3>

        <p>
            Fort Worth, the fifth-largest city in Texas, has seen home prices in some neighborhoods increase by as much as 320 percent between <a href="http://fortworth.culturemap.com/news/real-estate/03-29-18-most-gentrified-zip-code-downtown-fort-worth-76102/">2000-2016</a>. While the median home cost just under $47,000 in 2000, it shot up to $198,400 in 2016, according to RentCafe. And the percent of people with bachelor's degrees increased along with household income in this same time, by 122 percent and 103 percent, respectively.

    <h3>San Francisco, CA</h3>
    <img src="https://cdn.citylab.com/media/img/citylab/2015/08/Screen_Shot_2015_08_28_at_11.00.14_AM/940.png?mod=1494536990" alt="hey" height="400" width="600">
        <p>
            San Francisco: where the average studio costs about $2,400 monthly and the median home is worth <a href="https://cdn-blog-propertyshark-rs.netdna-ssl.com/Real-Estate-Reports/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/San-Francisco-Home-Price-Changes-by-Neighborhood.jpg">$1.61 million</a>. Historically low and middle-income neighborhoods like the Tenderloin, Chinatown and Bayview are rapidly becoming more <a href="https://sf.curbed.com/2017/11/17/16670116/uc-berkeley-urban-displacement-map-gentrification-oakland">expensive</a>, adding to the already dire housing crisis the city faces. Interesting, however, is that not all middle-income neighborhoods face the same level of gentrification; areas like the Sunset and Richmond districts have not shown a distinct increase in the number of wealthy residents.
