    <h1>Methodology</h1>

    <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            Gentrification is generally <a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/flagwars/what-is-gentrification/">defined</a> as the process of wealthier residents moving into urban areas and displacing the existing communities, and often falls on racial and economic lines. In a 2015 article in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/this-is-what-happens-after-a-neighborhood-gets-gentrified/432813/">The Atlantic</a>, Richard Florida writes "Displacement is becoming a larger issue in knowledge hubs and superstar cities, where the pressure for urban living is accelerating. These particular cities attract new businesses, highly skilled workers, major developers, and large corporations, all of which drive up both the demand for and cost of housing. As a result, local residents -- and neighborhood renters in particular -- may feel pressured to move to more affordable locations."

        <p>
            Benjamin Grant, an urban planner in the San Francisco Bay Area, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/flagwars/what-is-gentrification/">notes</a> that while gentrification has no clear-cut definition, it is often characterized by changes in demographics (increased median income, decline of proportion of racial minorities, and reduction in household size) as well as changes in real estate markets, like the increase of ownership units and rent prices. As such, changes in median income levels, property values, race and education are used as proxies in this app for measuring gentrification. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
            An example of a geographic region experiencing high levels of gentrification is the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/San+Francisco+Bay+Area,+CA/@37.8760261,-123.5442945,8z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808583a3a688d7b5:0x8c891b8457461fa9!8m2!3d37.8271784!4d-122.2913078">San Francisco Bay Area</a>. The <a href="http://www.urbandisplacement.org/map/sf">Urban Displacement Project</a>, a project organized by UC Berkeley, has analyzed tract-level data for population, housing units, median rent, median home value, median income, college-achievement levels and population of renters to create interactive maps that highlight areas at high risk of displacing existing communities. Neighborhoods with historically low-income and middle-income residents, like Bayview, the Tenderloin and Chinatown are all at risk for rampant gentrification.

    <h3>Data Sources</h3>
    <p>
        This app uses data collected by the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys.html">United States Census Bureau</a>.  Data comes from the 2000 <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/about.html">Decennial</a> and the 5-year <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html">American Community Survey</a> for 2009 and 2016. Geographic and map data from <a href="https://www.mapbox.com">Mapbox</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        Data points were chosen to measure gentrification based on similar analyses by <a href="http://www.governing.com/gov-data/gentrification-in-cities-governing-report.html">Governing</a>, a magazine devoted to policy, and <a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-trends/2013-economic-trends/et-20131106-gentrification-and-financial-health.aspx">Daniel Hartley</a>, research economist with the Cleveland Federal Reserve.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="http://www.governing.com/gov-data/gentrification-report-methodology.html">Governing</a> based their definition on gentrification on the oft-cited <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1078087404273341">research paper</a> on gentrification by Columbia University professor Lance Freeman. In the Governing analysis, determining factors of whether a tract gentrified or not was determined by 1) an increase in a tract's educational attainment, 2) an increase in a tract's median home value, and 3) the percentage increase in a tract's median home value compared with all tracts in the metro area. In their study, however, they focused on educational achievement rather than income levels because "...many of the first residents to 'gentrify' a neighborhood are often artisans or young professionals who might not earn much more than their new neighbors. Such changes to a community are not reflected in income levels." My app differs from theirs in that it considers both educational achievement and median income levels.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the analysis by Daniel Hartley, he used Census data from the 2000 Census and 2005-2009 American Community Survey. To gauge the level of gentrification, he looked at changes in the following Census data: 1) home prices, 2) rent prices, 3) median income, 4) proportion of population with bachelor's degrees, and 5) proportion of owner-occupied housing units.

    <h3>Limitations</h3>

    <p>
        The Census Bureau notes that while ACS and Decennial 2000 data can be compared, "differences in the universe, question wording, residence rules, reference periods, and the way in which the data are tabulated can impact comparability with Census 2000." As such, exact comparisons should be taken cautiously. A more detailed explanation of differences between surveys can be found at <a href="https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/census/decvsacs">North Carolina State University Libraries</a>.

    <h3>Technical</h3>
    <p>
        Data cleaning and analysis was conducted in <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a>. The web app is powered by <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a>, a microframework for Python. Mapping and geocoding services provided by <a href="https://www.mapbox.com">Mapbox</a>. Data visualizations were created with <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io">Altair</a>, a eclarative statistical visualization library for Python, based on <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/">Vega</a> and <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">Vega-Lite</a>.
