    <h1>Methodology</h1>

    <h3>Data</h3>
    <p>
        This app uses data collected by the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys.html">United States Census Bureau</a>.  Data comes from the 2000 <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/about.html">Decennial</a> and the 5-year <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html">American Community Survey</a> for 2009 and 2016. Geographic and map data from <a href="https://www.mapbox.com">Mapbox</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        Data points were chosen to measure gentrification based on similar analyses by <a href="http://www.governing.com/gov-data/gentrification-in-cities-governing-report.html">Governing</a> and <a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2013/11/why-some-places-gentrify-more-others/7588/">CityLab</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gentrification is generally <a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/flagwars/what-is-gentrification/">defined</a> as the process of wealthier residents moving into urban areas and displacing the existing communities, and often falls on racial and economic lines. In a 2015 article in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/this-is-what-happens-after-a-neighborhood-gets-gentrified/432813/">The Atlantic</a>, Richard Florida writes "Displacement is becoming a larger issue in knowledge hubs and superstar cities, where the pressure for urban living is accelerating. These particular cities attract new businesses, highly skilled workers, major developers, and large corporations, all of which drive up both the demand for and cost of housing. As a result, local residents -- and neighborhood renters in particular -- may feel pressured to move to more affordable locations."
    </p>
    <p>
        Benjamin Grant, an urban planner in the San Francisco Bay Area, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/flagwars/what-is-gentrification/">notes</a> that while gentrification has no clear-cut definition, it is often characterized by changes in demographics (increased median income, decline of proportion of racial minorities, and reduction in household size) as well as changes in real estate markets, like the increase of ownership units and rent prices. As such, changes in median income levels, property values, race and education are used as proxies for measuring gentrification. 
    </p>

    <p>
        An example of a geographic region experiencing high levels of gentrification is the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/San+Francisco+Bay+Area,+CA/@37.8760261,-123.5442945,8z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808583a3a688d7b5:0x8c891b8457461fa9!8m2!3d37.8271784!4d-122.2913078">San Francisco Bay Area</a>. The <a href="http://www.urbandisplacement.org/map/sf">Urban Displacement Project</a>, a project organized by UC Berkeley, has analyzed tract-level data for population, housing units, median rent, median home value, median income, college-achievement levels and population of renters to create interactive maps that highlight areas at high risk of displacing existing communities. Neighborhoods with historically low-income and middle-income residents, like Bayview, the Tenderloin and Chinatown are all at risk for rampant gentrification.

    <h3>Limitations</h3>

    <p>
        The Census Bureau notes that while ACS and Decennial 2000 data can be compared, "differences in the universe, question wording, residence rules, reference periods, and the way in which the data are tabulated can impact comparability with Census 2000." As such, exact comparisons for should be taken cautiously. A more detailed explanation of differences between surveys can be found at <a href="https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/census/decvsacs">North Carolina State University Libraries</a>.
