        <h1>Gentrification Index</h1>

        <div class="description">
            <p>This index was created by using Census data from the 2000 Decennial and 2016 and attempts to quantify the level of gentrification of an area by measuring the changes in population of white people, median age, median home value, number of owner-occupied homes, number of people with at least a bachelor's degree and income per capita. These data points were chosen based on similar gentrification analyses by <a href="http://www.governing.com/gov-data/gentrification-in-cities-governing-report.html">Governing</a> magazine and the <a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-trends/2013-economic-trends/et-20131106-gentrification-and-financial-health.aspx">Cleveland Federal Reserve</a>.</p>

            <p>Each variable is weighted based on perceived impact on gentrification. These weights are based on factors found to be associated with gentrification in an <a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2013/11/why-some-places-gentrify-more-others/7588/">analysis</a> conducted by Richard Florida of CityLab. In their analysis, they found the factors that impact gentrification most to be income per capita (positive correlation of .61), number of college-educated residents (.51), and housing prices (.40). They did not rate the number of owner-occupied units or median age for their correlation with gentrification, and they found no correlation between race and gentrification at the neighborhood level.</p>

            <p>As such, I have weighted each data variable accordingly: income per capita (.30), population with bachelor's or higher (.25), median home value, percentage of owner-occupied housing units (.15), median age (.05) and percentage of white people (.05). </p>
